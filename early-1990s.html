        Tim Berners-Lee wrote what would become known as WorldWideWeb on a NeXT
        Computer[4] during the second half of 1990, while working for CERN, a
        European nuclear research agency. The first successful build was
        completed by 25 December 1990, after two months of development.[7] The
        browser was announced on the newsgroups and became available to the
        general public in August 1991.[7][8] By this time, several others,
        including Bernd Pollermann, Robert Cailliau, Jean-François Groff,[9] and
        visiting undergraduate student Nicola Pellow – who later wrote the Line
        Mode Browser – were involved in the project.[7]

        WorldWideWeb is capable of displaying basic style sheets, downloading
        and opening any file type with a MIME type that is also supported by the
        NeXT system (PostScript, movies, and sounds), browsing newsgroups, and
        spellchecking. In earlier versions, images are displayed in separate
        windows, until NeXTSTEP's Text class gained support for Image objects.
        WorldWideWeb is able to use different protocols: FTP, HTTP, NNTP, and
        local files. Later versions are able to display inline images.

      <div id="right">Released in 1992, Viola was the invention of Pei-Yuan Wei, a member of the eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF) at the University of California, Berkeley. Viola was a UNIX-based programming/scripting language; the acronym stood for "Visually Interactive Object-oriented Language and Application".</div>
