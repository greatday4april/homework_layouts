        Separation of Concerns is an important software engineering concept. It's very easy to understand but in practice people maybe easy to steer away from it. It means separating independent components so that each component only needs to worry about their own responsibility so that can easily decoupled or reorganized. It also helps keeping the scope of each component relatively small and easy to manage. It avoids making the program too complex and hard to maintain.

        In our calculator example, if we look at the project layout here <a href="https://github.com/greatday4april/calc2/tree/calc_part2">https://github.com/greatday4april/calc2/tree/calc_part2</a>, you would find tests, calculator and calculations are separated. Calculator is the presentation layer which provide interface for all the functionalities including the history of calculations. It doesn't need to worry about the individual calculations while the calculation classes will take care of the implementation of different types of calculations. While tests folder will test the functionalities. This separation of concerns enables multiple developers work on the project and help the program scale.
