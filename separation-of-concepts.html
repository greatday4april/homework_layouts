        After the first internet browser (WorldWideWeb, known today as Nexus) launched, numerous companies launched their own internet browsers. One of them, Mosaic, dominated the browser market share for over a year after its release in 1993. Netscape stemmed from its success in 1994, and became the leading internet browser by 1995. In that same year, however, Microsoft launched Internet Explorer v1.0, and it looked as though Netscape would overshadow it just as it did all its other competitors.

        In 1994, the same organization, then known as Netscape Communications Corporation, released Netscape Navigator. This name may perk up some ears, and rightfully so. It was one of the first browsers to use “JavaScript”, one of most in-use programming languages today, and still the industry standard for scripting languages. Netscape Navigator became a household name as a consumer access point for using the internet, so much so that “Netscaping” became common vernacular, synonymous with “surfing the web".

      <div id="right">In the mid 1990s, the internet browser was a very new phenomenon, and most consumers would never think to replace the default browser on their operating system. Luckily for Microsoft, most operating systems at the time were Windows, and the default browser was Internet Explorer. </div>
