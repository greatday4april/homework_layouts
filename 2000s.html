        Safari was introduced within the Mac OS X Panther in January 2003, and as of 2021, spawned a total of 15 revisions. The third generation (May 2019) brought compatibility to the iPhone via iPhone OS 1, while the Macintosh edition was topped with the fastest browser performance at that time. The fifth version (June 2010) made uses of a less distracted screen reader, extension and developer tools; it was also the final version for Windows. In the eleventh version (September 2017), it added supports for the Intelligent Tracking Prevention. The thirteenth version included various privacy and application updates such as the FIDO2 USB security key authentication and Web Apple Pay support. The fourteenth version (November 2020) was the most-previous revision of Safari; it was up to 50% faster than Google Chrome and consumed less battery than other standard competitors. The fifteenth version (July 2021) was the current revision, featuring a redesigned interface.

        As of October 2021, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 68% worldwide browser market share (after peaking at 72.38% in November 2018) on personal computers (PC),[17] is most used on tablets (having surpassed Safari), and is also dominant on smartphones,[18][19] and at 65% across all platforms combined.[20] Because of this success, Google has expanded the "Chrome" brand name to other products: Chrome OS, Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and Chromebase.
