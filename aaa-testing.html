        AAA(Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern is standard for testing in software engineer industry. Basically it means a test needs to be composed of these 3 stages: Arrange means having setup, such as having mocks etc; then Act, basically invocate the method to be tested; and the last step is to verify the result meets expectation after the act (Assert).

        Testing is super important because it helps us verify the code we've written matches our expectation and has no bug. It also prevents other people from breaking the code while they are making changes. This allows collaboration between more developers on the same project.

        <a href="https://github.com/greatday4april/calc2/blob/calc_part2/tests/calculator_test.py#L26-L33">This</a> is an example of how tests are usually implemented. The test "test_calculator_add" does clear_history as the setup (Arrange) to clear history of the calculator to avoid side effects. And then perform actions, aka, adding different numbers. (Act) And then verify the results to be expected values. (Assert)
